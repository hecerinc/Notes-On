## Insuring your Health


> **insurance premium:** amount of money an individual or business pays for an insurance policy (costo anual)

Health insurance:


1. Private
	- 1.1 Traditional indemnity (fee-for-service)
	- 1.2 Managed care plans
		- HMOs
		- PPOs
		- EPOs
		- POS plans
2. Public


## Private Health Insurance Plans

> **Group health insurance**: health insurance consisting of contracts written between a group (employer, union, etc) and the health care provider.


![Health plan comparison](img/exhibit9.2.png)

> Employers are also shifting a larger percentage of the cost to employees. As a result, you may want to compare group and individual policies before deciding which coverage to buy.

Most private health insurance plans fall into one of two categories:

- **traditional indemnity (fee-for-service) plans**
- **managed care plans**


### Traditional Indemnity (Fee-for-Service) Plans

> indemnity (fee-for-service) plan: the health care provider is separate from the insurer, who pays the provider or reimburses you for a specified percentage of expenses after a deductible amount has been met.

- Insurer **pays the health care provider** or **reimburses** you
- Typicially pays 80% (you cover the rest)
- You have to pay a deductible ($100 - $2,000)
- The lower the deductible, the higher the premium
- Have to submit a claim for reimbursements

The amount the insurance company pays is commonly based on the usual, customary, and reasonalbe (UCR) charges - what the insurer considers to be the prevailing fees within your area, not what your doctor or hospital actually charges.

If your doctor charges more than the UCR charges, you may be responsible for the excess. UCR charges vary significantly among insurers, so you should compare your doctor's fees with what a plan pays. Many carriers offer indemnity plans wherein physicians who accept the insurance agree to accept the UCR payments set by the insurer. **There are few indemnity plans left in the US**.


### Managed Care Plans

> **managed care plans**: subscribers/users contract with the provider organization which uses a designated group of providers meeting specific selection standards to furnish health care services for a monthly fee.


- Managed care plans **don't pay deductibles**, but pay a small **copayment** fee for office visits and medications.
- Most medical services - including preventive and routine care that indemnity plans may not cover - are fully covered when obtained from plan providers.

Several types:

1. **Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)**
2. **Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs)**
3. **Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOS)**
4. **Point-of-Service Plans (POS)**


#### Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)

> **health maintenance organizations**: an organization of hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers that have joined to provide comprehensive health care services to its members, who pay a monthly fee.

- Pay a monthly fee
- Co-payment typically $5 to $50 USD each time that you use services or fill a prescription
- Services include:
	- doctor's visits
	- imaging and laboratory services
	- preventive care
	- health screenings
	- hospital inpatient care and surgery
	- maternity care
	- mental health care
	- drug prescriptions
- Advantages:
	- no deductibles
	- few or no exclusions
	- not having to file insurance claims
- Used to be assigned a **primary care physician (PCP)** but less common now, you can choose your own
- Some services require a referral from your PCP (specialists)


Two main types:

- **Group HMO**: employs a group of doctors to provide health care services _from a central facility_. Members obtain health care services from the doctors and other personnel who practice there. Most prevalent in larger cities
- **Individual practice association (IPA)**: Most popular type. IPA members receive medical care from indiviual physicians practicing _from their own offices and from community hospitals_ that are affilitated with the IPA. You get some choice.




#### Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs)

> **preferred provider organization**: a health provider that combines the characteristics of the IPA form of HMO with an indemnity plan to provide comprehensive health care services to its subscribers within a network of physicians and hospitals

- An insurance company or provider contracts with a network of physicians and hospitals that agree to accept the negotiated fee for medical services
- Unlike HMO, a PPO also provides insurance coverage **outside the PPO network**
- You pay a higher price for medical services provided by out-of-network doctors and hospitals


#### Other managed care plans

- **Exclusive provider organization (EPOs)**: contracts with medical providres to offer services to member at reduced costs, bu tit reimburses members only when affiliated providers are used
- **Point-of-service (POS) plan**: hybrid form of HMO that allows members to go outside of the HMO network for care. 


### Blue Cross/ Blue Shield Plans

> **Blue Cross/Blue Shield**: prepaid hospital and medical expense plans under which health care services are provided to plan participants by member hospitals and physicians

A prepaid hospital and medical expense plans. 



## Government Health Insurance Plans

### Medicare

> **Medicare**: a health insurance plan administered by the federal government to help persons age 65 and over, and others receiving monthly Social Security disability benefits, to meet their helath care costs.


- Designed to help persons 65 and over
- Also covers many people udner 65 who receive monthly Social Security disability benefits
- Funds are paid by taxes
- Traditionally provides two primary components:
	- Basic hospital insurance
	- Supplementary medical insurance as well as prescription drug coverage

#### Basic hospital insurance (Part A)

- Provides inpatient hospital services (room, board, etc) for the first 90 days of illness.
- A deductible is applied during the first 60 days of illness.
- Co-insurance provisions, applicable to days 61-90 of the hospital stay, can further reduce benefits.
- Up to 100 days of post-hospital extended-care faciliites (e.g. nursing homes)


#### Supplementary medical insurance (SMI) (Part B)

- Covers physicians and surgeons in addition to the costs of medical and health services such as imaging, laboratory tests, prosthetic devices, rental of medical equipment, and ambulance transportation.
- Also covers some home health services and limited psychiatric care

SMI is a **voluntary program** for which participants pay premiums, which are then matched with government funds.

Anyone 65 and over can enroll in SMI.


#### Medicare Advantage Plans (Part C)

- Provide Medicare benefits to eligible people, but they differ in that they are administered by private providers rather than by the government
- Supplementary benefits include: vision, hearing, dental, general checkups, and health and wellness programs
- Members may pay an additional monthly premium, but many of the private providers don't charge this
- Usually pay a fixed co-payment for each doctor visit, rather than pay a deductible


#### Prescription drug goverage (Part D)

- Insurance covering both brand-name and generic prescription drugs at participating pharmacies.
- **Voluntary program** pay a monthly fee and a yearly deductible, which vary by provider.
- Also pay part of the cost of drugs, including a co-payment or co-insurance

Many Medicare enrolees buy private insurance policies to fill the gaps that Medicare does not provide.


### Medicaid

State-run public assitance program that provides health insurance to those who are unable to pay. Each state has its own regulations about who is eligible for coverage and the types of medical services that are covered. 

### Worker's compensation insurance

Designed to compensate workers who are injured on the job or become ill through work-related causes.

- Managed by each state
- Employers bear nearly the entire cost of worker's compensation insurance in most states
- Premiums are based on historical use
- Self-employed people are required to contribute to worker's compensation for themselves and for their employees




## Affordable Care Act (ACA) (Obamacare)


Two goals:

- Reduce the number of uninsured citizens in the country
- Reduce the increases in health care costs by providing a "state-based" health insurance exchange in each state

Provisions:

- Employers with > 50 full time employees are required to provide insurance or face a penalty equal to $2,000 times the number of employees less 30.
- All individuals not covered by Medicare or Medicaid are required to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty that will amount to the greater of $695 per adult ($347.50 per child) or 2.5% of the family income in 2016.


Essential health benefits required by the ACA:

- Ambulatory patient services
- Emergency services
- Hospitalizations
- Maternity and newborn care
- Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment
- Prescription drugs
- Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices
- Laboratory services
- Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management
- Pediatric services, including oral and vision care

Additional features:

- Cover pre-existing conditions
- Parents mus thave the option to carry their children on their plan until age 26
- Life time dollar limits on total insurance coverage are prohibited
- Plans must cover preventive care and medical screenings
- Insurers must spend at least 80$ of premiums on claims


### Insurance Exchanges

## Health insurance decisions

Evaluate:

- potential areas of loss
- types of coverage
- otherr resources available to you and your family
- any gaps in protection


### Health care cost risk

Most people need protection against two types of losses that can result from illness or accidents:

1. Expenses for medical care and rehabilitation
2. Loss of income or household services caused by an inability to work.

Long-term costs for medical care can range from $300,000 to $1 million. This cost is difficult to estimate.

Loss of income is easy to calculate: a % of your (or your spouse's) current monthly earnings. MOst experts believe that **60 to 75%** is sufficient.

Consider strategies in minimizing risk:

- **Risk avoidance**: look for ways to avoid exposure to health care loss. E.g.: don't take illegal drugs, refuse rides on motorcycles, don't smoke (in bed and start a fire).
- **Loss prevention and control**: Smoking, alcohol, and drug dependency, impromper diet, inadequate sleep, and lack of regular excercise contribute to more than 60% of all diagnosed illnesses. Eliminating some or all of these factors from your lifestylue can reduce your chances of becoming ill. Also don't drive while intoxicated, and wear a seatbelt.
- **Risk assumption**: Consider the risks that you're willing to retains as you deal with health insurance decisions. Some risks pose relatively small loss potential; you can budget for them rather than insure against them.


### Determine available coverage and resources

- Some employers offer employees a _flexibile-benefit ('cafeteria') plan_ offering a choice of benefits.
- Typically, the menu of benefits includes more than one health insurance option, as well as life insurance, disability income insurance, and other benefits.
- The employer sets a dollar amount that it will provide, and employees choose a combination from these benefits, depending on their preferences and circumstances.
- If, after choosing your benefits from the menu offered, you decide you want or need additional insurance benefits, most employers will set up a salary reduction agreement with the employee.

#### Health reimbursement account (HRA)

Some employeres offer consumer-directed health plans that go one step beyond a flexible-benefit cafeteria plan. Typicially, these plans combine a high-deductible health insurance policy with a tax-free **health reimbursement account (HRA)**.

> **health reimbursement account (HRA)**: An account into which employers place contributions that employees can use to pay for medical expenses.

When the account is used up, you must pay the remaining deductible of the health insurance policy before insurance begins to pay. If you don't use the money by the end of the year, you can "roll over" the amount; after several years of rolling it over, you could accumulate quite a bit of cash to pay for medical expenses.

**If you change jobs, the money stays with the employer.**

The IRS considers employer contributions to medical reimbursement accounts to be tax-free income.

#### Health savings account (HSA)

> **health savings account (HSA)**: a tax-free savings account - funded by employees, employer, or both - to spend on routine medical costs. Usually combined with a high deductible policy to pay for catastrophic care.

- The HSA is also a tax-free account, but **the money is funded by employees, employeres, or both** to spend on routine medical costs
- Combined with high-deductible insurance policy to pay for catastrophic care in case of major accident o illness and **can be rolled over each year**.
- If you change your jobs, **the HSA money belongs only to you and is yours to keep**.


In addition to the HSA and HRA, there are many other consumer-directed health plans. There are also **flexibile spending accounts (FSAs)** that allow employees to contribute pre-tax dollars to an account that must be spent on qualified medical (or dependent care) expenses.

**If the account balance is not spent during the year, it is not carried over to the next year.**


#### COBRA

If you're laid off or leave a job where you've had health benefits, then you are legally eligible to continue your coverage for a period of 18 months under federal COBRA regulations.

You'll be responsible for paying the full cost of the insurance if you decide to continue during this time, but you'll still pay group insurance rates that are often less expensive than buying individual insurance.

However, **you must arrange to continue your coverage** before leaving your former employer. 

There are **critical enrollment windows** and policy coverage details to compare.


#### Retiree coverage

> Another important area of group coverage to consider is retiree benefits. The number of companies providing health insurance to retirees has decreased sharply, so you may not be able to count on receiving employer-paid benefits once you retire. Medicare will cover basic medical expenses, but you'll probably want to supplement this coverage with one of the 12 standard Medigap plans, which are termed plans "A" through "L".



Look for a carrier that is highly rated by at least two of the major rating agencies and has a reputation for settling claims fairly and promptly. 

The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) is a good source of information. This non-profit, unbiased organization issues annual "report cards" that rate the service quality of various health plans.



### Choose a health insurance plan


- If you're employed, check the health insurance plans your company offers
- If you can't get coverage from an employer, get plan descriptions and costs from several providers, including a group plan from a professional or trade organization if available
- Also check the state or federal insurance exchange available to you
- Carfeully read the plans to understand what is covered and what cost
- Add up what you've spent on medical costs over the past few years and what you might expect to spend in the future, so you can see what your costs would be under various plans.

Before choosing a particular plan, you should ask yourself some important questions to decide whether you want an indemnity plan or a managed care plan:

1. **How important is cost compared with having freedom of choice?**. You may have to pay more to stay with your current doctor if he or she is not part of a manged care plan that you're considering. 

> Some states have experimented with the **comunity rating approach to health insurance premium pricing**, which prohibits insurance companies from varying rates based on health status or claim history. The "community" is defined as the area in which the insurance is offered.

2. **Will you be reimbursed if you choose a managed care plan and want to see an out-of-network provider?** For most people, the managed care route is cheaper, even if you visit a ddoctor only once a year, because of indemnity plans "reasonable charge" provisions.
3. **What types of coverage do you need?** You may want a plan with good maternity and pediatric care, whereas another may want outpatient mental health benefits. Make sure the plans you're considering offer what you want.
4. **How good is the managed care network?** Look at the participating doctors and hospitals to see how many of your providers are part of the plan. Check out the credentials of participating providers; a good sign is accreditation from the NCQA. Are the provider's locations convenient for you? What preventive medical programs does it provide? Has membership grown? Talk to friends and associates to see what their experiences have been with the plan.
5. **How old are you, and how's your health?** Many financial adviors recommend buying the lowest-cost plan &mdash; which may be an indemnity plan with a high deductible &mdash; if you're young and healthy.

After considering all of the coverage and resources available to you, consider where gaps in your health insurance coverage may lie and how best to fill them. 


## Medical expense coverage and policy provisions

![Health Insurance Checklist](img/ws_91_hic.png)

### Types of medical expense coverage

#### Hospitalization

Hospitalization policies usually pay for a portion of:

- hospital's daily semiprivate room rate (includes meals, nursing care, and other routine services)
- cost of ancilliary services, such as laboratory tests, imaging, and medications

Many plans also cover some outpatient and out-of-hospital services once you're discharged, such as in-home rehabilitation, diagnostic treatment, and preadmission testing.

Some hospitalization plans simply pay a **flat rate amount** for each day the insured is in the hospital, regardless of actual charges.

**Most policies set a limit on the number of days of hospitalization and a maximum dollar amount on ancilliary services that they will pay for.**

#### Surgical expenses

Covers the cost of surgery in or out of the hospital. Usually part of a hospitalization insurance or as a rider to such a policy. Most plans reimburse you for _reasonable and customary_ surgical expenses based on a survey of surgical costs during the previous year. 

- **They may also cover anesthesia, nonemergency treatment using imaging, and a limited allowance for diagnostic tests**
- Scheduled benefits are often inadequate when compared with typical surgical costs.
- Most elective cosmetic surgery is typically excluded unless deemed medically necessary.

#### Physician expenses

_Physicians expense insurance_, also called _regular medical expense_, covers the cost of **visits to a doctor's office** or for a doctor's hospital visits, including consultation with a specialist.

Also covered are **imaging and laboratory tests preformed outside of a hospital**.

Often these plans specify a **maximum payment per visit** as well as a maximum number of visits per injury or illness.


#### Major medical insurance

> **Major medical plans**: An insurance plan designed to supplement the basic coverage of hospitalization, surgical, and physician expenses; used to finance more catastrophic medical costs.

- In the past it was common to have lifetime limits of $500K or $1M, but the ACA eliminates lifetime limits

#### Comprehensive major medical insurance

> **comprehensive major medical insurance**: a health insurance plan that combines into a single policy the coverage for basic hospitalization, surgical, and physician expenses along with major medical protection.

- Usually with a low deductible
- Often written uder a group contract


#### Dental services

Dental insurance covers necessary dental care and some dental injuries sustained through accidents.

#### Limited protection policies


Insurance companies offer other options that provide limited protection against certain types of perils:

- **Accident policies**: certain types of accidents
- **Sickness policies**: a.k.a _dread disease policies_, pay a specified sum for a named disease, such as cancer
- **Hospital income policies**: promise to guarantee a specific daily, weekly, or monthly amount as long as the insured is hospitalized


Sound insurance planning seldom dictates the purchase of such policies. Be aware that the extra cost of purchasing these insurance options typically otweighs the limited coverage they provide.


### Policy provisions

Policy provisions can be divided into 2 groups:

1. terms of payment
2. terms of coverage

#### Terms of payment

Four provisions govern how much your health insurance plan will pay:

1. deductibles
2. the participation (co-insurance) clause
3. the policy's internal limits
4. coordination of benefits clause, if any


##### Deductibles

> **deductible**: the initial amount _not_ covered by an insurance policy and thus the insured's responsibility; it's usually determined on a calendar-year basis or on a per-illness or per-accident basis.


Major medical insurance plans offered under an indemnity (fee-for-service) plan often have a relatively large _deductible_, typically $500 or $1,000.

- Comprehensible major medical plans tend to offer lower deductibles, sometimes $100 or less. 
- Most plans offer a calendar-year, all-inclusive deductible. This allows the person to accumulate the deductible from more than one incident of use.
- _Carryover provision_: any part of the deductible that occurs during the final three months of the year can be applied to the current year's deductible and can _also_ be applied to the following calendar year's deductible.

![Effect of Per-Illness, Per-Accident deductible](img/example_deductible.png)

##### Participation (co-insurance)

> **participation** or **co-insurance clause**: A provision in many health insurance policies stipulating that the insurer will pay some portion &mdash; say, 80 or 90% &mdash; of the amount of the covered loss in excess of the deductible rather than the entire amount.

- Helps reduce the incentive for policyholder to fake an illness and discourages them from incurring unnecessary medical expenses.
- _Stop loss provision_: places a cap on the amount of participation required.


> Without a stop-loss provision, a $1 million medical bill would leave the insured with $200,000 of costs under an 80% plan. Often such provisions limit the insured's participation to less than $10,000 and sometimes to as little as $2,000.


##### Internal limits

> **internal limits**: A feature commonly found in health insurance policies that limits the amount that will be paid for certain specified expenses, even if the claim does _not_ exceed overall policy limits.

Common charges subject to internal limits include:

- hospital room & board
- surgical fees
- mental and nervous conditions
- nursing services

##### Coordination of benefits

> **coordination of benefits provision**: A provision often included in health insurance policies to prevent the insured from collecting more than 100% of covered charges; it requires that benefit payments be coordinated if the insured is eligible for benefits under more than one policy.

- Many private health insurance policies coordinate benefit provisions with medical benefits paid under workers' compensation.
- In contrast, some companies widely advertise that their policies will pay claims regardless of other coverage the policyholder has.
- Using policies with coordination of benefits clauses can help you prevent coverage overlaps and, ideally, reduce your premiums.
