# Chapter 8: Insurance



## Life insurance

- Its primary purpose is to protect your dependents from financial loss in the event of your untimely death.
- Life insurance protects your family from the potentially catastrophic financial damage caused by the premature death of the major breadwinner

### Benefits

1. Financial protection for dependents
	- e.g. paying off mortgages, setting aside funds for college etc.
2. Protection from creditors
	- Death benefits are paid directly to a named beneficiary instead of being considered as part of your estate. This means that  even if you have outstanding bills and debts at the time of your death, creditors cannot claim the cash benefits from your life insurance policy, which provides further financial protection for your dependents.
3. Tax benefits
	- They're generally not subject to income tax deductions (state _or_ federal) and some can be configured so as not to be subject to _estate_ taxes.
	- En México también están exentos sin importar quiénes sean los beneficiarios

### Relevant questions

1. Do you need life insurance?
2. If so, how much do you need?
3. Which type of life insurance is best, given your financial objectives?
4. What factors should you consider in making the final purchase decision?

#### 1. Do you need life insurance?

The main purpose is to **protect your dependents**. Therefore, if you don't have dependents, you probably don't need life insurance (this includes single adults and children, for example).

How much life insurance you need is a function of how many **dependents** you have and how many **assets** you want to protect.

#### 2. How much is right for you?

There are two methods used to determine this:

1. **Multiple-of-earnings method**
2. **Needs-analysis method**

##### Multiple-of-earnings

Take your gross annual earnings and multiply it by an arbitrary number (usually **5 to 10 times** your current income). You should only use this to _approximate life insurance needs_.


##### Needs-analysis

Considers

1. financial obligations
2. financial resources of the insured and his/her dependents.

##### Method:

1. Estimate the total economic resources needed if the individual were to die.
2. Determine all financial resources that would be available after death, including existing life insurance and pension plan death benefits
3. Substract available resources to the amount needed


###### 1. Assessing needs

> What financial resources will my survivors need should I die tomorrow?

When answering this, consider:

1. **Income needed to maintain an adequate lifestyle**:
	- _How much money would your dependents need each month to live comfortably?_
	- Estimate by looking at current monthly budget (expenses for housing, utilities, medical, food, property, taxes, insurance, travel & leisure, savings)
	- Consider these expenses change over time (e.g. when children leave the house)
2. **Extra expenses if the primary producer dies**:
	- Funeral costs
	- Services you don't currently provide (cleaning, cooking etc)
3. **Special needs of dependents**:
	- Emergency funds, college education fund etc.
4. **Debit liquidation**:
	- Calculate average amount of outstanding bills (credit cards, department stores, home mortgage)
5. **Liquidity**:
	- Your dependents need liquid assets (i.e. cash) while  your illiquid assets are sold

###### 2. Determine what resources will be available

- Savings
- Investments
- Social security survivor benefits
- Accumulated pension plans
- Profit-sharing programs
- Income that can be earned by surviving spouse or children


Once you have calculated the needs and resources, you can substract these values and **this equals the life insurance needed**.

##### Underwriting

Underwriting tries to determine the risk potential of individuals (the likelihood that the individual will die while the policy is in effect).

Factors include

- longevity for various age groups
- medical history (e.g. heart disease)
- habits and conditions (smoking, obesity, diabetes)
- dangerous jobs or hobbies
- driving under the influence (or driver's license supension)


#### 3. What kind of policy is right for you?

3 kinds account for most types of life insurance:

1. Term life
1. Whole life
1. Universal life

##### Term life

- A specified amount for a set period. (5 years, 10 years, 30 years).
- Depending on the policy, premiums can be paid semi-anually, anually or quarterly
- **Straight term** or **decreasing term**

###### Straight term

- Written for a set period during which time the insurance coverage remains unchanged.
- **Annual premiums** may increase (annual renewable term policies) or remain level (level premium term policies)
- Level term are more popular


###### Decreasing term

- Maintain a _level premium_ throughout all periods of coverage while the _amount of protection decreases_

| | |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Advantages** | Cost (cheap). Good for covering needs that will disappear over time |
| **Disadvantages** | Offers only _temporary_ coverage. Once the term expires, you must renew the policy. This can be a problem if you develop underwriting conditions during that period that make it difficult to qualify for insurance |
| **Who should buy it** | Young families on limited budgets should buy guaranteed **renewable** and **convertible** term life policies |


##### Whole Life

- Provides permanent insurance.
- Generally has savings features (**cash value**)
	- return rates are normally _fixed_ and _guaranteed_ to be higher than a certain rate (typically 4 to 6 %)
- 3 major types exist:
	- Continuous premium
	- Limited payment
	- Single premium

###### Continuous premium (straight life)

- Level premium each year until they die
- The earlier in life the coverage is purchased, the lower the annual premium
- Insurance sellers will try to convince young people using this argument (but of course, the less you pay anually, you pay it longer, therefore you pay total more)
- Good reasons exist for young people to buy insurance, but paying less annually should not be the only one
- Probably the **wisest choice to fill a permanent life insurance need**

###### Limited payment

- Covered for your entire life
- Premium is paid for a **specified period**
- On completion of payment periods, the insurance remains in force, for the rest of the insured's life


###### Single premium (SPLI)

- One cash premium payment at the inception of the contract (buying life insurnace coverage for the rest of your life)
- Interest/investment earnings on the policy are tax deferred
- Any widthdrawals or loans taken against the SPLI cash value before age 59 1/2 are not only taxed at capital gains, but are also subject to a 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal

| | |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Advantages** | Premium payment contribute toward building an estate, regardless of how long the insured lives. Favorable tax treatments are given to accumulated earnings. |
| **Disadvantages** | Cost. Less death protection per premium dollar than term. Investment features provide lower yield than otherwise comparable investment options. |
| **Who should buy it** | Increased risk of health problems (disqualifiers). |



##### Universal Life

- Combines term insurance (death benefits a.k.a. pure insurance) with cash value (tax-sheltered savings/investment account that pays interest)
- Pure insurance and savings are unbundled (specified separately in the premium)
- Premium payment is used to pay for administrative costs.
	- **The remainder** is put into cash-value portion of the policy, where it generates return
	- Each month the cost of 1 month's term insurance is drawn from the cash value to purchase death protection
	- If cash value grows large, death protection must increase to retain tax benefits (tax laws require that death benefits in universal life policies _always exceed the cash value_ by a stipulated amount)



| | |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Advantages** | **Flexibility**. Annual premium can be increased or decreased from year to year, because the cost of the death protection may be covered from either the annual premium or the accumulation account (i.e. the cash value). The death benefit can also be increased or decreased.  This flexibility allows you to adapt the death benefit to your life-cycle needs—for example, increasing the death benefit when you have another child and decreasing it when your children are grown. **Savings feature**. |
| **Disadvantages** | **Charges and fees**. Heavy fees |
| **Who should buy it** | Looking for a greater ROI. People anticipating changes in death protection. |


##### Group Life Insurance

- One master policy is issued and each elegible member of the group receives a certificate of insurance
- Nearly always term insurance
- Employers often provide this as a fringe benefit to employees
- Accounts for about 1/3 of US insurance (fastest growing)
- Group life policies also normally include dependents
- Members who leave the group can convert to whole life individually issued policies if leaving within a specified period

### Buying life insurance

- compare costs and features
- select a financially healthy insurance company
- choose a good agent

#### Compare costs and features

- Look at current rates
- Find out how long they will stay locked in
- Find out max you can be charged when you renew
- Establish _how long_ you will need the coverage and then find the best rates **for the total period**
- Get the features you need (e.g. convertibility)
- Be sure that the policies you are comparing have similar provisions and amounts
- **First decide how much and what kind of policy you want, _and then compare_**

#### Selecting a company

- Besides looking for reasonably priced products, attractive features, and good customer service, it's vital to consider **financial health of any insurance firm**
- Age & size are useful indicators (> 25 years, annual premium > $100M)
- Financial history, reputation, comissions and other fees
- Company's investment performance and dividend history (for cash value)

Private rating agencies can help with this:

- A.M. Best
- Fitch
- Moody's
- Standard & Poor's

These firms evaluate the company's _claims paying ability_
