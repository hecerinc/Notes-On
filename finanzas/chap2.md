## Using Financial Statements &amp; Budgets

3 instruments:

1. Financial plans: road map to show you the way
1. Financial statements: let you know where you stand
1. Budgets: allow you to monitor and control expenses and purchases in a manner that is consistent with your financial plans

## Terms

- **personal financial statements**: planning tools to for developing and monitoring personal financial plans
	- 1. **Balance sheet**: describes your financial position at a _given point_ in time
	- 2. **Income &amp; Expense statement**: measures financial performance _over_ time
- **budgets**: detailed financial report that looks _forward_, based on expected income and expenses


## Balance sheet

Tracking your progress toward your financial goals.

3 parts:

1. **Assets**: what you own
1. **Liabilities (debts)**: What you owe
1. **Net worth**: Difference between your assets and liabilities

```
Net worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
```

### Assets

- Items **you own**.
- Whether purchased with cash or financed using debt (even if you haven't fully paid for an asset, _you should list it in your balance sheet_).
- Don't add _leased_ items (you don't own them).

Assets can be grouped as follows:

- **Liquid assets**: Low-risk financial assets held in cash or instruments that can be liquified quickly, with little or no loss in value. (e.g. Cash on hand or in a checking or savings account, money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds, certificates of deposit that mature within 1 year)
- **Investments**: Assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate that are acquired in order to earn a return rather than provide a service.
	- Business ownership
	- Cash value of life insurance and pensions
	- Retirement funds (IRAs and 401(k) plans)
	- Commodities / financial futures / options
- **Real property**: Tangible assets that are immovable: land and anything fixed to it, such as a house. **Appreciates** (increases in value over time).
- **Personal property**: Tangible assets that are movable and used in every day life (cars, recreational equipment, household furnshing and appliances, clothing, jewelry, home electronics). Typically __depreciate__ (declines in value) shortly after being put into use.


All assets should be recorded at their current **fair market value**, which may differ considerably from their original purchasing price.

- **fair market value**: the actual value of an asset (for money), or the price for which it can reasonably be expected to sell in the open market (e.g. used car or home)

### Liabilities

**Debts.**

- Department-store charges
- Bank credit card charges
- Installment loans
- Mortgages on housing or other real estate

Generally classified according to maturity:

- **Current (short-term) liability**: Currently owed an due within 1 yera of the date of the balance sheet (consumable goods, utility bills, rent, insurance premiums, taxes, medical bills, repair bills and total **open account credit obligations** (outstanding balances against credit lines)
- **Long-term liability**: Debt due >= 1 year from the date of the balance sheet. (Real estate mortgages, most consumer installment loans, education loans, etc)


Regardless of the type **only the latest outstanding balance** should be shown as a liability on the balance sheet (what is still due is what matters at any given point in time, not the initial loan balance).

Only the outstanding principal portion of a loan or mortgage should be listed as a liability on the balance sheet (i.e. _do not include the interest portion of your payments_)

> **principal** is the amount of debt you owe at a given time

### Net worth

The actual amount of wealth or **equity** that an individual or family has in owned assets. Substract total liabilities from total assets.


If nw < 0, family (or individual) is **insolvent**. 


### Steps to making a balance sheet

1. **List your assets at their fair market value as of the date you are preparing the balance sheet.** Estimate the value of homes an dcars using published sources of information, such as advertisements from comparable homes and the _Kelley Blue Book_ for used car values. Consider item appreciation and depreciation.
1. **List all current and long-term liabiliites.** 
1. **Calculate net worth.**


## Income &amp; Expense Statement

What you earn and where it goes. Captures the various financial transactions that ocurr over a period of time (usually a **year** or a **month**).

3 components:

1. **Income**: what goes in
2. **Expenses**: what goes out
3. **Cash surplus (or deficit)**: `income-expenses`

> The statement is prepared on a **cash basis**, which means that only transactions involving actual cash inflows or actual cash outlays are recorded.

**Income**

- Wages
- Salaries
- Self-employment income
- bonuses
- comissions
- interest &amp; dividends received from savings and investments
- proceeds from sale of assets such as stocks and bonds
- pension
- annuity
- Social security income
- Rent received from assets
- Alimony
- Scholarships / grants
- tax refunds

The proper figure to use is **gross income**: amount received _before_ taxes. This is used because the taxes and payroll deductions will be itemised and deducted as expenses later in the income and expense statement.


**Expenses**

Cash out.

- Living expenses (housing, utilities, food, transportation, medical, clothing, insurance)
- Tax payments
- Asset purchases
- Other payments for personal care, recreation &amp; entertainment

**Fixed** (e.g. utilities, mortgages) vs **variable** expenses (e.g. food, clothing, entertaiment).


Important measure: average annual expenses by major category as a percentage of after-tax income.

### Steps to preparing the income &amp; expense statement

Date the sheet to define the period covered.

1. **Record your income from all sources for the chosen period.** Use paycheck stubs. Include bonuses, comission checks, overtime pay. Keep a running list of other income sources, such as rents, tax refunds, and asset sales.
1. **Establish meaningful expense categories.**
1. **Subtract total expenses from total income to get cash surplus or deficit.**


- Credit purchases are shown as an asset and corresponding liability on the balance sheet.
