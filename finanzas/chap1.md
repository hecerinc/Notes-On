# Chapter 1: Understanding the Financial Planning Process

- Whatever your ideal life is, it requires financial planning to acheive financial goals
- The best way to acheive financial goals is through _personal financial planning_, which help
	- define financial goals
	- develop appropriate strategies to reach them
- We should **NOT** depend solely on employee or governement benefits (social security) to retire comfortably
- Creating flexible plans and _revising them constantly_ is the key to financial soundness
- Goals should be SMART
- A carefully developed financial plan should set aside a portion of current income for deferred, future spending. Placing these funds in various savings and invest- ment vehicles allows you to generate a return on your funds until you need them

### Steps


The personal financial process is a loop:

1. Define financial goals
1. Develop financial plans and strategies to achieve goals.
1. Implement financial plans and strategies
1. Periodically develop and implement budgets to monitor and control progress toward goals.
1. Use financial statements to evaluate results of plans and budgets, taking corrective action as required.
1. Redefine goals and revise plans and strategies as personal circumstances change.


#### Financial goals

- **Financial goals**: results than an individual wants to obtain, such as buying a home, building a college fund, or acheiving financial independence.

Financial goals are established in monetary terms. Money is not necessarily what people ultimately want, but rather the **utility**: the amount of satisfaction received from purchasing certain types or quantities of goods and services

##### The Psychology of Money

Your personal value system — the important ideals and beliefs that guide your life—will also shape your attitude toward money and wealth accumulation.
