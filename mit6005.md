### Immutable references

Java also gives us immutable references: variables that are assigned once and never reassigned.To make a reference immutable, declare it with the keyword `final`:

```
final int = 5;
```

It's good practice to use `final` for declaring the parameters of a method and as many local variables as possible.

Method parameters, in particular, should generally be left unmodified. (This is important for being ready-for-change — in the future, some other part of the method may want to know what the original parameters of the method were, so you shouldn't blow them away while you're computing.) It's a good idea to use final for method parameters, and as many other variables as you can. The final keyword says that the variable should never be reassigned, and the Java compiler will check it statically.



In Java, a global variable is declared `public static`. The `public` modifier makes it accessible anywhere, and `static` means there is a single instance of the variable.


Good practices in Java:


- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Comments where needed
- Fail fast
- Avoid magic numbers
- One purpose for each variable
- Use good names
- No global variables
- Return results, don't print them
- Use whitespace for readability


## Specifications

Specifications are the linchpin of teamwork. It's impossible to delegate responsibility for implementing a method without a specification. The specification acts as a contract: the implementer is responsible for meeting the contract, and a client that uses the method can rely on the contract. 

Specifications are good for the client of a method because they spare the task of reading code.
Specifications are good for the implementer of a method because they give the implementor freedom to change the implementation without telling clients.

A specification of a method consists of two clauses:

- a _precondition_, indicated by the keyword _requires_
- a _postcondition_, indicated by the keyword _effects_

Example:

```
static int find(int[] arr, int val)
	requires: val occurs exactly once in arr
	effects:  returns index i such that arr[i] = val
```

The **precondition** is an obligation on the client (i.e., the caller of the method). It's a condition over the state in which the method is invoked.

The **postcondition** is an obligation on the implementer of the method. If the precondition holds for the invoking state, the method is obliged to obey the postcondition, by returning appropriate values, throwing specified exceptions, modifying or not modifying objects, and so on.

If the precondition does not hold when the method is called, the implementation is not bound by the postcondition. It is free to do anything, including not terminating, throwing an exception, returning arbitrary results, making arbitrary modifications, etc.


Java has a convention for [documentation comments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc), in which parameters are described by `@param` clauses and results are described by `@return` and `@throws` clauses. You should put the preconditions into `@param` where possible, and postconditions into `@return` and `@throws`. So a specification like this:

```Java
/**
 * Find a value in an array.
 * @param arr array to search, requires that val occurs exactly once
 *            in arr
 * @param val value to search for
 * @return index i such that arr[i] = val
 */
static int find(int[] arr, int val)
```

A specification of a method can talk about the parameters and return value of the method, but it should never talk about local variables of the method or private fields of the method's class. You should consider the implementation invisible to the reader of the spec.

But it's important to note that **even glass box tests must follow the specification**. Test cases must obey the contract, just like every other client.

So what does glass box testing mean, if it can't go beyond the spec? It means you are trying to find new test cases that exercise different parts of the implementation, but still checking those test cases in an implementation-independent way.

### Exceptions

An unfortunately common way to handle special results is to return special values. Lookup operations in the Java library are often designed like this: you get an index of `-1` when expecting a positive integer, or a `null` reference when expecting an object. This approach is OK if used sparingly, but it has two problems. First, it's tedious to check the return value. Second, it's easy to forget to do it. (We'll see that by using exceptions you can get help from the compiler in this.)

Also, it's not always easy to find a ‘special value'. Suppose we have a BirthdayBook class with a lookup method. Here's one possible method signature:

```Java
class BirthdayBook {
    LocalDate lookup(String name) { ... }
}
```

What should the method do if the birthday book doesn't have an entry for the person whose name is given? Well, we could return some special date that is not going to be used as a real date. Bad programmers have been doing this for decades; they would return `9/9/99`, for example, since it was obvious that no program written in 1960 would still be running at the end of the century. ( They were wrong, by the way.)

Here's a better approach. The method throws an exception:

```Java
LocalDate lookup(String name) throws NotFoundException {
	...
	if ( ...not found... )
		throw new NotFoundException();
	...
```

and the caller handles the exception with a catch clause. For example:

```Java
BirthdayBook birthdays = ...
try {
	LocalDate birthdate = birthdays.lookup("Alyssa");
	// we know Alyssa's birthday
} catch (NotFoundException nfe) {
	// her birthday was not in the birthday book
}
```

Now there's no need for any special value, nor the checking associated with it.



#### Checked and unchecked exceptions

We've seen two different purposes for exceptions: special results and bug detection. As a general rule, you'll want to use checked exceptions to signal special results and unchecked exceptions to signal bugs. In the next section of this reading, we'll refine this a bit.

__Checked exceptions__ are called that because they are checked by the compiler:

- If a method might throw a checked exception, the possibility must be declared in its signature. `NotFoundException` would be a checked exception, and that's why the signature ends with `throws NotFoundException`.
- If a method calls another method that may throw a checked exception, it must either handle it, or declare the exception itself, since if it isn't caught locally it will be propagated up to callers.

__Unchecked exceptions__, in contrast, are used to signal bugs. These exceptions are not expected to be handled by the code except perhaps at the top level. We wouldn't want every method up the call chain to have to declare that it (might) throw all the kinds of bug-related exceptions that can happen at lower call levels: index out of bounds, null pointers, illegal arguments, assertion failures, etc.


Here's how Java distinguishes between checked and unchecked exceptions:


- `RuntimeException`, `Error`, and their subclasses are __unchecked__ exceptions. The compiler doesn't require them to be declared in the throws clause of a method that throws them, and doesn't require them to be caught or declared by a caller of such a method.
- All other throwables — `Throwable`, `Exception`, and all of their subclasses except for those of the `RuntimeException` and `Error` lineage — are __checked__ exceptions. The compiler requires these exceptions to be caught or declared when it's possible for them to be thrown.


When you define your own exceptions, you should either subclass `RuntimeException` (to make it an unchecked exception) or `Exception` (to make it checked). Programmers generally don't subclass `Error` or `Throwable`, because these are reserved by Java itself.



#### Exception design considerations


- You should use an unchecked exception only to signal an unexpected failure (i.e. a bug), or if you expect that clients will usually write code that ensures the exception will not happen, because there is a convenient and inexpensive way to avoid the exception;
- Otherwise you should use a checked exception.

Here are some examples of applying this rule to hypothetical methods:

- `Queue.pop()` throws an _unchecked_ `EmptyQueueException` when the queue is empty, because it's reasonable to expect the caller to avoid this with a call like `Queue.size()` or `Queue.isEmpty()`.
- `Url.getWebPage()` throws a _checked_ `IOException` when it can't retrieve the web page, because it's not easy for the caller to prevent this.
- `int integerSquareRoot(int x)` throws a checked `NotPerfectSquareException` when `x` has no integral square root, because testing whether `x` is a perfect square is just as hard as finding the actual square root, so it's not reasonable to expect the caller to prevent it.

The cost of using exceptions in Java is one reason that many Java API's use the null reference as a special value. It's not a terrible thing to do, so long as it's done judiciously, and carefully specified.

However, because exceptions in Java are designed for use only under exceptional circumstances, few, if any, JVM implementations attempt to optimize their performance. On a typical machine, the exception-based idiom runs **70 times slower than the standard one** when looping from 0 to 99.
